The theme for [my Tumblr-powered weblog][1], written in Haml and Sass.

I'm publishing this project online mainly for my own benefit. Be
prepared to gut and hack this thing if you want to use it for your own
Tumblr weblog; it only supports the small subset of Tumblr's features
that I use, it's a colossal pain in the arse to customise if you're not
me, and I'm prone to making drastic changes on a whim.

Having said that, feel free to browse the code and pinch bits for your
own theme or whatever. This theme uses the [HTML5 Shiv][2] and
[SelectNav.js][3] JavaScript libraries. I can't offer much in the way of
support, except for maybe saying "good luck".
